// Internal clock @ 8MHz - This code is using the internal oscillator
// so don't expect the clock speed to be too accurate.  In my tests the
// output was within about 10 KHz of the expected value - close enough
// for this application.
#define F_CPU 8000000

// Global includes
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The period and mark must be a whole number in the range of 0 to 255 and the
// mark *MUST* be lower than the period.  Due to the clock speed of the ATtiny45
// you have to take the required microseconds (uS) and divide it by 0.03125 (and
// round up) to get the desired value.
//
// For example: if you want the default Acorn setting of a 200 KHz clock this would
// require a period of 5 uS (1,000,000 uS per second / 200,000 Hz = 5 uS period) and
// the default mark of 1 uS:
//
// Period of 5uS = 5uS / 0.03125 = 160
// Mark of 1uS = 1uS / 0.03125 = 32
//


// The following clock configurations can be selected by setting the DIP switch
// as shown (0 = Off, 1 = On):
//
// DIP SW	Period (uS)	Mark (us)	Psetting	Msetting
// 000		5.00		1.000		160			32			
// 001		4.00		0.750		128			24

	// The comments attempt to mirror the datasheet so you can see

	// Initialize Timer/Counter1 for asynchronous mode:

	// To set Timer/Counter1 in asynchronous mode first enable PLL
	// and then wait 100 uS for PLL to stabilize. Next, poll
	// the PLOCK bit until it is set and then set the PCKE bit.
	
	// Enable PLL

	// OC1B cleared on compare match. Set when TCNT1 = &00
	// OC1B set on compare match. Cleared when TCNT1 = &00
	GTCCR |= (0 << COM1B1) | (1 << COM1B0);
	
	// Now we have to enable the clock and set the prescaler value
	// (prescale is the amount the clock is divided before being
	// used as an input to Timer/Counter1).  The faster the clock
	// ticks, the more accurately we can time the period and mark
	// needed for the Econet clock, but the overall period is then
	// less (since the timer is 8-bit and can only span a maximum
	// of 255 ticks).  So we want a prescale value as low as possible
	// but not so low that we can't support the maximum period.
	//
	// The default clock frequency is 200 KHz with a mark of 1uS and
	// a space of 4uS (meaning the overall period is 5uS).  Since there
	// are 1,000,000uS in a second this means our clock frequency is 
	// 1,000,000 / 5us = 200,000 Hz or 200KHz.
	//
	// We want to support a minimum period of 0.25uS and a maximum
	// period of 8.0uS (i.e. 4000 KHz to 125 KHz).
	//
	// The PLL clock is 64MHz (i.e. 64,000 KHz) meaning that each tick
	// is 1,000,000uS / 64,000,000 Hz = 0.015625 uS meaning our maximum
	// period is 3.984375 uS (about 251 KHz).  Since we need a maximum
	// period of 200 KHz we can divide the prescaler by 2 which halves
	// our resolution (i.e. accuracy).
	//
	// At PCK/2 the clock is 32 MHz meaning each tick is 1,000,000 uS /
	// 32,000,000 Hz = 0.03125 uS meaning our maximum period is 7.96875
	// uS (about 125.5 KHz) - perfect :)
	//
